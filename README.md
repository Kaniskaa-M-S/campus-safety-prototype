# Campus Safety Prototype

A multidisciplinary campus safety framework combining geospatial crime analysis, 
predictive modeling, and embedded systems design for urban university environments.

## Overview

This project addresses systemic campus safety gaps through data-driven analysis 
and a working hardware prototype. The core analytical contribution is a geospatial 
crime mapping pipeline built on the Cornell Police crime log, identifying spatial 
patterns in incidents, lighting deficiencies, unauthorized access points, and 
emergency response delays across campus.

## Urban Data Science Components

- Automated scraping, cleaning, and geocoding of Cornell University Police Department crime logs
- Geospatial crime hotspot mapping using GeoPandas and Folium — static plots and live heatmaps
- Predictive model trained on historical crime data to forecast risk levels by time, location, and incident type
- Stakeholder survey analysis across students, faculty, and campus security
- Flask web dashboard integrating real-time crime indicators and geographic visualizations

## Hardware Prototype

- Raspberry Pi 5 embedded system with multi-modal alert mechanisms
- AI-based fall detection achieving 92.6% F1-score in testing
- Voice-activated alerts, manual panic buttons, LED feedback, FM alarms
- Low-latency design optimized for real-world deployment
